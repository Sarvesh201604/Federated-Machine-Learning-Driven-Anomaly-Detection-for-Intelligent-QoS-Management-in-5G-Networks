# 5G/IoT Network Simulation with Adaptive QoS

## Overview
This project simulates a dynamic 5G network environment designed to evaluate Adaptive Quality of Service (QoS) algorithms. It models the interaction between different network entities (User Equipment, Base Stations, IoT Sensors) and manages various traffic types with distinct performance requirements.

The simulation helps in understanding how network resources are allocated under different load conditions and how critical traffic (like Emergency signals) is prioritized over standard traffic.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Node Network Topology
- **UE Nodes (User Equipment)**: Mobile devices (smartphones, vehicles) that move around the simulation area and consume bandwidth.
- **eNodeB (Base Stations)**: Fixed infrastructure providing network coverage and connectivity.
- **IoT Nodes**: Stationary sensors sending periodic telemetry data.
- **Core Node**: The central backbone managing high-level routing and varying buffer capacities.

### 2. Diverse Traffic Classes
The system simulates four distinct traffic categories, each with specific QoS requirements:
- **Emergency**: Highest priority, ultra-low latency, high reliability (e.g., medical alerts).
- **Video Streaming**: High bandwidth, moderate latency (e.g., 4K streaming).
- **IoT/Sensor Data**: Low bandwidth, loose latency constraints (e.g., weather monitors).
- **Messaging**: Standard priority, normal latency (e.g., text, email).

### 3. Adaptive QoS & Routing
- Dynamic packet prioritization based on traffic class.
- Smart routing to avoid congested nodes.
- Load balancing to maintain network stability during high traffic spikes.

## Project Structure

- **`mainapp.py`**: **The Simulation Engine**
  - Defines all classes (`Node`, `Packet`, `TrafficType`).
  - Sets up the environment (stadium/city layout).
  - Runs the simulation loop (mobility, packet generation, routing).
  - Generates raw metrics and saves them to the `results/` directory.

- **`simulation.py`**: **The Analysis Dashboard**
  - Loads the data generated by `mainapp.py`.
  - Launches an interactive Matplotlib dashboard.
  - Visualizes key metrics: Packet Delivery Ratio, Average Latency, and Node Load.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas seaborn networkx
```

### Step 1: Run the Simulation
Execute the main application to start the simulation. This will generate the necessary data files.
```bash
python mainapp.py
```
*You can customize parameters via command-line arguments (check the code for available flags).*

### Step 2: Visualizing Results
Once the simulation is complete, run the dashboard script to analyze the performance.
```bash
python simulation.py
```
This will open a GUI window where you can explore different scenarios and export reports.

## Outputs
- **Console Logs**: Real-time stats during simulation.
- **`results/`**: Directory containing CSV logs for each scenario.
- **`network_topology.png`**: Visual map of the initial network layout.
- **Animations**: (Optional) MP4 video of the network traffic flow.
