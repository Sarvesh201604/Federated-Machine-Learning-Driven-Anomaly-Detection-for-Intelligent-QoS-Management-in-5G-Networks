            dynamic traffic classification and prioritization mechanisms proved effective in optimizing
            resource utilization while ensuring that critical communications were always given
            appropriate priority.</p>
            
            <p>Further research is recommended to explore machine learning approaches for predictive
            traffic management and more sophisticated failover mechanisms.</p>
