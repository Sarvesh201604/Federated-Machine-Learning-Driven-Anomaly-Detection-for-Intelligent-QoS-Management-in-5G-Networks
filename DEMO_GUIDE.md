```

**Step 3: Narrate While Running:**
```
[When Step 1 appears]
"Setting up 5G network with 5 base stations..."

[When Step 2 appears]  
"Generating training data - each station gets 200 samples mixing normal and anomalous traffic..."

[When Step 3 appears]
"Now executing federated learning... notice accuracy improving from 34% in Round 1..."
[When Round 10 completes]
"...to 88% in Round 10. That's the power of federated collaboration."

## 💬 ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS CONFIDENTLY

### Q: "How do you find anomalies?"
```
"We use a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network trained on 8 traffic features:
latency, throughput, packet loss, jitter, queue length, load, traffic type, and history.

The model learns patterns from labeled training data and outputs anomaly probability.
Probability > 0.5 indicates anomaly. This achieved 88% accuracy."
```

### Q: "What is an anomaly in your system?"
```
"An anomaly is traffic that deviates from normal patterns:

NORMAL: Latency <30ms, Loss <5% → Probability <0.5
SUSPICIOUS: Latency 50-150ms, Loss 10-30% → Probability 0.5-0.7
MALICIOUS: Latency >200ms, Loss >40% → Probability >0.7

Examples: Normal video streaming, IoT malfunction, or DDoS attack respectively."
```

### Q: "How did you find the difference between baseline and your system?"
```
"We ran controlled experiments on the same network with same traffic.

Baseline uses: Cost = Latency + Load
Our system uses: Cost = Latency + Load + (Anomaly × Penalty)

With 30% anomalous traffic, baseline achieved 51.93ms latency 
while our system achieved 26.76ms - a 48.47% improvement.

The difference comes from our system isolating malicious traffic
to alternative paths, protecting normal traffic."
```

### Q: "How can you simulate and show this?"
```
"I can demonstrate three ways:

1. Complete system: python integrated_fl_qos_system.py (20 seconds)
2. Interactive demo: python interactive_demo.py (5 minutes with explanations)
3. Individual modules: Each component separately testable

Right now, I'll run the complete system..."
[Then run it live]
```

### Q: "Why federated learning?"
```
"Because 5G networks are distributed:

Traditional: All data sent to central server - privacy issues, high bandwidth
Federated: Each base station trains locally, only shares model weights

Benefits:
- Privacy preserved (no raw data sharing)
- Low bandwidth (MB vs GB)
- Scalable (works for 1000+ base stations)
- Better model (learns from diverse local patterns)"
```

### Q: "Is this a security project?"
```
"No sir, it's a QoS protection project. Security is secondary.

Our goal is maintaining quality of service for legitimate users 
when abnormal traffic appears. Anomaly detection is the tool,
QoS protection is the objective."
```

### Q: "What's your novelty?"
```
"The novelty is integrating ML-based anomaly detection directly
into routing cost calculation:

Traditional papers: Detection OR Routing (separate)
Our system: Detection + Routing (integrated)

Formula innovation: Adding (Anomaly × Penalty) to routing cost
makes routing behavior-aware, not just metric-aware."
```

│   Where:                                        │
│   - Anomaly = ML model output (0-1)             │
│   - Penalty = 1000 (configurable)               │
│                                                 │
│   Benefit: Behavior-aware routing               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Example Calculation:

Normal Traffic (Anomaly = 0.05):
  Cost = 20ms + 5ms + (0.05 × 1000) = 75ms

Malicious Traffic (Anomaly = 0.90):
  Cost = 20ms + 5ms + (0.90 × 1000) = 925ms
  
  → Router avoids malicious path!
```

```

### "Can you disable anomaly awareness?"
```python

## 🎤 OPENING STATEMENT (Memorize This)

When you first present:

```
"Good morning/afternoon sir/madam,

I am [Your Name] presenting our final year project:
'Federated Learning-Driven Anomaly Detection for 
Intelligent QoS Management in 5G Networks'

Our project addresses a critical gap in 5G QoS management.
Traditional routing only considers metrics like latency and load,
treating all traffic equally. This leaves systems vulnerable to
abnormal traffic that degrades quality of service.

We developed a novel approach where routing decisions are enhanced
with federated learning-based anomaly detection. Our key innovation
is the routing formula: Cost = Latency + Load + (Anomaly × Penalty),
which makes routing behavior-aware instead of just metric-aware.

Our system achieved 88% anomaly detection accuracy and 48% latency
improvement over baseline, successfully demonstrating that integrating
ML-based anomaly awareness into routing protects QoS for critical services.

I can now demonstrate the complete system if you'd like."
```

**Duration: 1 minute**
