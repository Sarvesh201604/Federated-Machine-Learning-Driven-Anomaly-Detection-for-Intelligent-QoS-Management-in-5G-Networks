# VIVA QUICK REFERENCE SHEET 🎯

## MEMORIZE THESE NUMBERS:
- **Latency Improvement:** 48.47%
- **Final FL Accuracy:** 88.3%
- **Base Stations:** 5
- **Training Samples per BS:** 200 (140 normal, 60 anomaly)
- **FL Rounds:** 10
- **Anomaly Detection Rate:** 32%
- **Baseline Latency:** 51.93 ms
- **Our System Latency:** 26.76 ms

---

## THE NOVELTY (ONE SENTENCE):
"We integrate ML-based anomaly detection directly into QoS routing cost calculation, making routing decisions behavior-aware instead of just metric-aware."

---

## THE FORMULA (MEMORIZE THIS):
```
Traditional: Cost = Latency + Load
Our System:  Cost = Latency + Load + (Anomaly × Penalty)
```

---

## WHAT IS THE PROJECT? (30 SECONDS):
"Intelligent QoS routing framework for 5G networks that uses federated learning-based anomaly detection to protect service quality by identifying and avoiding abnormal traffic behavior during routing decisions."

---

## WHAT PROBLEM DOES IT SOLVE?
"Traditional QoS routing cannot distinguish normal from abnormal traffic behavior. Our system detects patterns like IoT floods, fake priority requests, or sudden bursts, and adapts routing to protect critical services."

---

## WHY FEDERATED LEARNING?
"Because 5G is distributed. Each base station has different patterns. FL allows local learning without centralized data collection, matching real architecture and preserving privacy."

---

## IS THIS A SECURITY PROJECT?
"No sir. Security is not the primary objective. We use anomaly detection as an intelligence layer to protect QoS performance for critical applications."

---

## 4 KEY MODULES:
1. **data_logger.py** - Collects traffic metrics
2. **local_model.py** - ML at each base station  
3. **federated_server.py** - FedAvg aggregation
4. **anomaly_router.py** - Intelligent routing (NOVELTY)

---

## HOW DOES FEDAVG WORK?
"Each base station trains locally, sends only weights to server. Server averages weights: Global_Weight = (1/N) × Σ(Local_Weights). Global model distributed back to all nodes."

---

## HOW DOES ROUTING WORK?
"Traffic features → ML model → Anomaly probability → Calculate cost (Latency + Anomaly×Penalty) → Dijkstra's algorithm → Best path. High anomaly = expensive link = alternate route chosen."

---

## TOOLS USED:
- Python 3
- scikit-learn (MLPClassifier)
- NetworkX (topology & routing)
- NumPy/Pandas (data processing)
- Matplotlib (visualization)

---

## 3 NOVELTY POINTS:
1. **Behavior-aware QoS routing**
2. **Federated Learning for 5G QoS**
3. **Anomaly detection for QoS protection (not security)**

---

## SYSTEM WORKFLOW (5 PHASES):
1. Data Collection at each BS
2. Local Training (each BS learns)
3. Federated Aggregation (FedAvg)
4. Model Distribution (global model to all)
5. Intelligent Routing (anomaly-aware decisions)

---

## TO DEMO:
```bash
python integrated_fl_qos_system.py
```
Takes 20 seconds, shows all phases clearly.

---

## RESULTS GRAPH SHOWS:
1. FL accuracy improving (34% → 88%)
2. Our system has lower latency (box plot)
3. Consistent performance (time series)
4. Network topology (5 nodes, 8 links)

---

## IF THEY SAY "YOU HAVEN'T DONE MUCH":
"Sir, we have implemented complete system:
- ✅ 5 modular Python files
- ✅ Full FL pipeline with FedAvg
- ✅ Anomaly detection model (88% accuracy)
- ✅ Intelligent routing (48% improvement)
- ✅ Working end-to-end simulation
- ✅ Performance validation with graphs"

---

## IF THEY ASK "WHAT'S NEW HERE?":
"Existing papers treat anomaly detection and QoS routing as separate problems. Our novelty is integrating anomaly awareness directly into routing cost calculation, making QoS routing intelligent and adaptive to traffic behavior."

---

## IF THEY ASK ABOUT DATASET:
"We generated synthetic traffic data based on realistic 5G metrics. Each base station has 200 samples with features: latency, throughput, packet loss, jitter, queue length, load, traffic type, and label (normal/anomaly)."

---

## IF THEY ASK "WHY NOT DEEP LEARNING?":
"We chose MLPClassifier because:
1. Sufficient for our feature space
2. Built-in incremental learning (warm_start)
3. CPU-optimized, no GPU needed
4. Faster training for federated setting"

---

## WHAT IS MLP? (Multi-Layer Perceptron):
"MLP is a feedforward artificial neural network with input, hidden, and output layers. It learns non-linear patterns through backpropagation."

**Our Architecture:**
```
Input Layer (8 features) → Hidden Layer 1 (10 neurons) → Hidden Layer 2 (5 neurons) → Output (Normal/Anomaly)
```

**Configuration:**
- Activation: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
- Optimizer: Adam (adaptive learning rate)
- Learning Rate: 0.001
- **Key Feature: warm_start=True** (enables incremental learning for FL)

---

## 8 FEATURES USED FOR TRAINING:
1. **Latency** - Packet delay (ms)
2. **Throughput** - Data rate (Mbps)
3. **Packet Loss** - Loss percentage
4. **Jitter** - Latency variation (ms)
5. **Queue Length** - Packets in queue
6. **Load** - Network utilization (0-1)
7. **Traffic Type** - Protocol identifier
8. **Label** - 0=Normal, 1=Anomaly (target)

**Why these features?**
"These are standard 5G QoS metrics that directly indicate network health and anomaly patterns. High latency + low throughput + high packet loss = clear anomaly signature."

---

## WHY MLP (NOT OTHER MODELS)?
| Model | Why NOT Used |
|-------|-------------|
| Decision Tree | No incremental learning support |
| CNN | Designed for images, overkill here |
| LSTM/RNN | For time-series, we process individual packets |
| Deep Neural Net | Needs GPU & more data, unnecessary |
| **MLP ✅** | **Perfect balance: incremental + efficient + accurate** |

---

## IF THEY ASK ABOUT MLP:
"MLP is our anomaly detection model. It's a neural network with 2 hidden layers (10 and 5 neurons) that processes 8 traffic features. We chose it because warm_start parameter enables incremental learning—critical for federated learning where models update over multiple rounds. It runs on CPU at base stations, achieving 88.3% accuracy. The model outputs anomaly probability used in routing cost calculation."

---

## CONFIDENCE STATEMENT:
"Our system achieved 48% latency improvement by making routing behavior-aware. This demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating federated learning with QoS routing for 5G networks."

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT:
"We have successfully moved QoS routing from a metric-based approach to a behavior-aware intelligent system, improving network resilience under abnormal conditions while maintaining privacy through federated learning."

---
